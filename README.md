# projects-portfolio
I am planning over the next year to further improve my coding and software enjeneering skills.
By the end of the academic year 2020-2021, to have finished coding 30 projects that can be used outsourced and utilised.

The main language i hope to be working in is python. Despite this, i will have to use other languages to create front end functionality to my projects. My projects will fit into three categories:
* api and back end work
* front end gui
* data storage and object orientation

Further more, many of these projects may overlap multiple sections.
